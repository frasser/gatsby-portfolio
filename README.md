    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
